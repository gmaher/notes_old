abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States and is responsible for 17{\%} of national health expenditures. As the population ages, these costs are expected to increase substantially.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS: To prepare for future cardiovascular care needs, the American Heart Association developed methodology to project future costs of care for hypertension, coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke, and all other CVD from 2010 to 2030. This methodology avoided double counting of costs for patients with multiple cardiovascular conditions. By 2030, 40.5{\%} of the US population is projected to have some form of CVD. Between 2010 and 2030, real (2008{\$}) total direct medical costs of CVD are projected to triple, from {\$}273 billion to {\$}818 billion. Real indirect costs (due to lost productivity) for all CVD are estimated to increase from {\$}172 billion in 2010 to {\$}276 billion in 2030, an increase of 61{\%}.\backslashn\backslashnCONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate CVD prevalence and costs are projected to increase substantially. Effective prevention strategies are needed if we are to limit the growing burden of CVD.},

	abstract = {How can we perform efficient inference and learning in directed probabilistic models, in the presence of continuous latent variables with intractable posterior distributions, and large datasets? We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions is two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.},
